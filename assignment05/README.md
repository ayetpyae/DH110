# Assignment 5: Low Fidelity Prototype
Aye Pyae | DH110 | Fall 2021

## Overview

**Purpose**  
Low Fidelity Prototyping is an effective and inexpensive way to test whether the features I hope to implement will be useful and helpful for my target users. I hope to understand how users will interact with the application and make improvements before working on the high fidelity prototype.

**Personas**
The user personas and scenarios I created are the following:
- A stay-at-home mother with low technical literary and wants to learn more about her children's schooling.
- A new teacher with high technical literacy who wants to learn more about different programs and organizations he can join.

**Features and Tasks**
1. **Chat Box**: A live chatbox feature will be helpful for getting answers to questions immediately - just like a phone call but digital instead.
2. **More organized Menu/Navigation Bar**: A more organized navigation bar needs to be created as the current one was found to be too cluttered.
3. **Advanced Search with Filters**: An advanced search with filters will allow users to more effectively find information on what they need.

## Low Fidelity Prototype Testing
I conducted the low fidelity prototype testing in person and my participant used my iPad to connect the wireframes and I screen recorded the process. I guided her to try out the features and complete the tasks. She talked out loud throughout the process and noted the places where she was confused.

## Reflection
+1: Summary of the process, what went smoothly or differently from your expectation
+1: What you would change or design differently based on the feedback you got from the prototype testing. 

Overall, the testing went smoothly and there were no major hiccups as the participant was able to complete the tasks easily. Based on the feedback I got from the prototype testing, the following are some things I would change:
- Tabs: I drew the tabs (Open tab from chat, Contact) by darkening the background and drawing rounded corners on the top. However, my participant did not seem to realize that these were supposed to be tabs and that when she exits out of them, she would go back to the previous screen. She thought exiting from the tabs would lead to the next screen. I need to make them a little more explicit. Another thing is that I drew the screens in order so that kind of gave it away and my participant simply connected the screens from left to right, top to bottom. 
- Unnecessary "x"s: For many of the screens, I put an "x" on the top right corner so that the users can exit out of whereerver they were and go back to home. However, my participant noted that some of the screens did not need them as there was already a back to home button. 
- Better links between screens: My participant noted that for the second task that there was not an explicit link between the educator\career and educator\pop-up pages. I think I could combine the two screens into just one to make it more user-friendly. I put too many screens that were not useful.

Overall, it an enjoyable process to create the wireframes and wireflows and watching my work come to live. I jotted down the flow of my screens in words first which helped in organizing my thoughts and design process.
