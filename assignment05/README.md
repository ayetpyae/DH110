# Assignment 5: Low Fidelity Prototype
Aye Pyae | DH110 | Fall 2021

## Overview

**Purpose**
Low Fidelity Prototyping is an effective and inexpensive way to test whether the features I hope to implement will be useful and helpful for my target users. I hope to understand how users will interact with the application and make improvements before working on the high fidelity prototype.

**User research**

**Personas**

**Features and Tasks**
1. Chat Box: A live chat box feature will help 
2. More organized Menu/Navigation Bar: 
3. Advanced Search with Filters: An advanced search with filters will allow users to more effectively find information on  what they need.


## Wireframes and Wireflows
+1:  At least three distinctive wireframes (= sketches of the screen) that represent the user flow (the input and output of the system) 
+1: Thoughtful content design including proper texts and button labels

+1: At least one sequence of the user interaction flow was presented with wireframes and arrow_lines 
+1: At least two tasks (from persona + usage scenario) were presented via wireflow
+1: Complete interaction sequences for all the possible choices and exit/cancel/back were clearly presented via wireflow

## Low Fidelity Prototype Testing
+1: Note the tester’s confusion or unexpected interaction; Note whether the tester could successfully complete the tasks 
+1: pictures/video of the tester’s walkthrough pathway


## Reflection
+1: Summary of the process, what went smoothly or differently from your expectation
+1: What you would change or design differently based on the feedback you got from the prototype testing.
