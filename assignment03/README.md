## Step 1: Specify the research goals & requirement
### What is the main activity your project would support?
•	This project will support users in finding information on K-12 education, as well as the different kinds of educational systems in the United States.
### What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity?
•	This activity fulfills the user’s cognitive needs, as finding out information about something specific about K-12 education in the United States satisfies the user’s curiosity. By browsing the internet to scour for information, users will be able to satisfy their hunger for knowledge.
### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
•	The traditional solution to finding information on K-12 education would be by calling local school districts, or through word-of-mouth from other parents, administrators, teachers, etc. Users can also go online to find information by reading blogs and news articles, watching videos, and visiting websites such as the state Department of Education website.
•	With COVID-19 came the need for digitized information, as people are not able to meet face to face. People increasingly relied on information online. However, this was difficult because some sites were not up to date or correct.
### What is (are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
•	Limitations of getting information from calling local school districts is that you can only find information on one school district at a time. It is time consuming, and it is laborious on the person on the other end (the administrator answering the questions) as well.
•	Limitations of getting information through word-of-mouth is that people do not get a record of the information they get unless they decide to record the conversations. It may also not be organized as they are usually structured as casual conversations.
## Step 2: Target users
### What are the characteristics of users?
•	Demographics: Parents, people with children, or people who are looking to have children in the near future
•	Preference: Users are proactive and want to get all the information they can get about the educational system in the United States so that they can make decisions for their children’s schooling.
•	Expertise: Users do not need any particular level of expertise to use this application

### In what context (where, why) would the users do that activity?
•	The users would find information on K-12 education when they are about to have children or when their children is about to start their schooling. For most users (parents), they would want their children to have the best education possible and they would want to do extensive research on the different resources that schools provide, and more. The user interviewed in this contextual inquiry participated in a task where they relied on their main source of information gathering (online), to learn more about the K-12 education system.

### What do/did the users usually do in order to complete that activity?
•	The users would do research on the educational systems in the United States by using their main source of information gather, be it talking to people around them who are familiar with the topic: parents with children in K-12 schooling, school administrators, etc., or finding information online by doing Google searches.

## Step 3: Research Method
•	I decided to use a combination of two methods: participatory observation and interview.
o	For participatory observation I observed how my participant gathered her information online.
o	For the interview, I asked her some questions on her thoughts on K-12 education and her ways of finding information on that topic (online, word-of-mouth, etc.)
•	Both were conducted over a Zoom call. As the participant was in another city, this was the most viable option. 
•	I used an iPhone to voice record the interview and I recorded the interview and participatory observation through Zoom/our own webcams. 

## Step 4: Observation/Interview Guide
Here is the link to the interview script.

## Step 5: Conducting the research
•	Here is the video recording of the interview and participatory observation.
•	Here are the voice recordings of the interview and participatory observation.
•	Here is the transcription of the whole interview and participatory observation.
•	Note: The internet connection was lost on my end at around the 36min mark. Hence, the video only recorded the first 36min. However, we continued the interview over phone so the rest of it is on the second voice recording.
•	Some interesting insights from the interview:

## Step 6: Reflection
I enjoyed the contextual inquiry process because it allowed me to make observations and learn from users freely. I learned a great deal about the users’ perspective and how they approach things.
