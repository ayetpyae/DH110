# Assignment 7: High Fidelity Prototype
Aye Pyae | DH110 | Fall 2021

## Introduction
The current Nevada Department of Education website looks old, formal, and cluttered. This was found to be the case after I conducted my user testing as well as my contextual inquiry. Previously, I made lo fi wireframes that were tested out by a user. I also tested out different interface designs to make visual improvements to the current Nevada Department of Education website. In this assignment, I will be working on the interactive prototype.   

**Purpose:** The purpose of the interactive prototype phase is to better visualize the functions of various features I wish to implement.   

**Process:** The process of this phase include 
1. choosing tasks/features based on the personas I created, 
2. digitizing the hand-drawn wireframe sketches I made,
3. applying interface design to the digital wireframes/lo-fi prototype, and finally
4. connecting the different screens using the prototype feature on Figma.

Here is the link to the [figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/trP3i7bvv5q4Fne0HNCsaw/Interface-Design?node-id=61%3A1582) with my high fidelity prototype screens.

## Tasks
1. **Chatbox** - Suppose that you are a mother of 2 elementary school students. You want to find more information on how schools are dealing with COVID.
  a. Open chat box feature.
  b. Ask question on COVID-19 safety measures schools are taking. 
  c. Fill out the feedback form after you're done chatting.

2. **Book an appointment** - Suppose that you are a Nevada public high school teacher. You need to renew your teaching license. 
  a. Schedule an appointment to do so.

## Cognitive Walkthrough
The main feedback I got when I conducted the in-class cognitive walkthrough was for the chat box feature. I showed my tester my wireframes as well as my interface design and told them to look through the screens and make comments. My tester noted one very important point, which was that when users want to use the chat box feature, they want their questions answered as soon as possible. I had initially done it so that users would have to input their contact information and choose a topic before they are brought to the chatbox. Hence, I decided to delete these steps and add some possible topics on the first chatbox screen.

**Comments from in-class cognitive walkthough activity, 11/16/2021**
- *"...result of clicking student/ parent/ educator buttons not clear..."*
- *"...icons make it pretty clear where to click..."*
- *"...user might want minimal steps between clicking chat button and actually getting to the chat room..."*
