# Assignment 7: High Fidelity Prototype
Aye Pyae | DH110 | Fall 2021

## Introduction
The current Nevada Department of Education website looks old, formal, and cluttered. This was found to be the case after I conducted my user testing as well as my contextual inquiry. Previously, I made lo fi wireframes that was tested out by a user. I also tested out different interface designs to make improvements to the Nevada Department of Education website. In this assignment, I will be working on the interactive prototype. The purpose of the interactive prototype phase is to better visualize the functions of different buttons and features that I wish to implement. The process of this phase include 
1. choosing tasks/features based on the personas I created, 
2. digitizing the hand-drawn wireframe sketches I made,
3. applying interface design to the digital wireframes/lo-fi prototype, and finally
4. connecting the different screens using the prototype feature on Figma.

## Tasks
1. **Chatbox** - Suppose that you are a mother of 2 elementary school students. You want to find more information on how schools are dealing with COVID.
  a. Open chat box feature.
  b. Ask question on COVID-19 safety measures schools are taking. 
  c. Fill out the feedback form after you're done chatting.

2. **Book an appointment** - Suppose that you are a Nevada public high school teacher. You need to renew your teaching license. 
  a. Schedule an appointment to do so.
