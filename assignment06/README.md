# Assignment 6: Interface Design
Aye Pyae | DH110 | Fall 2021

## Introduction
The current Nevada Department of Education website looks old, formal, and cluttered. This was found to be the case after I conducted my user testing as well as my contextual inquiry. In this assignment, I will be testing out different interface designs to make improvements to the Nevada Department of Education website. I will be testing out different typefaces and fonts, shapes, as well as colors. I will also be taking into consideration accessibility, particularly color contrast. All of these will be done on the homepage. The homepage is the most important page as it sets the tone for the rest of the website. Here is the link to the [figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/trP3i7bvv5q4Fne0HNCsaw/Interface-Design?node-id=9%3A736) with the design variations. (Each section is on a different page)
