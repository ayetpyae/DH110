# Assignment 6: Interface Design
Aye Pyae | DH110 | Fall 2021

## Introduction
The current Nevada Department of Education website looks old, formal, and cluttered. This was found to be the case after I conducted my user testing as well as my contextual inquiry. Previously, I made lo fi wireframes that was tested out by a user. In this assignment, I will be testing out different interface designs to make improvements to the Nevada Department of Education website. I will be testing out different typefaces and fonts, shapes, as well as colors. I will also be taking into consideration accessibility, particularly color contrast. All of these will be done on the homepage. The homepage is the most important page as it sets the tone for the rest of the website. Here is the link to the [figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/trP3i7bvv5q4Fne0HNCsaw/Interface-Design?node-id=9%3A736) with the design variations. (Each section is on a different page)

## Screen Design
### Typography variations:

The first variation I tested out was the combination of Raleway and Open Sans.
The second variation I tested out was the combination of Lato and Catamaran.
The third variation I tested out was the combination of Rubik and Karla. 

### Shape variations:

I tested out the roundedness of the shapes, as well as their sizes. I liked the first one the best as I felt like it was the most balanced. The second one was too round, which I thought made it look a little casual and informal. The third one was just for fun. It is too "fun" for a state government website in my opinion. 

### Color variations:

I chose to do light and dark modes for the color variations. 

### Layout:

I read the guidelines provided by https://material.io/design/layout/responsive-layout-grid.html#columns-gutters-and-margins to determine how many columns and rows I should use, as well as what to set the margins and gutters as. 

## Impression Test
"Looks cohesive...Simple. It looks like there's a lot of blank space here (pointing at the area underneath search bar). But much better than the current one..."

I asked my participant to compare the homepage I designed with the original homepage. Overall, they told me that they liked my design and that it looked simple and clean. However, they said that they would like it if there was a short description of what the Department of Education of Nevada does. They thought that I could add a little bit more information about it. They also pointed out that it looked a little empty. I will be making changes based on what they said and I will be implementing them. For my final screens, I will be making it so that the page can be scrolled and more information can be obtained. 

Note: I did not get an audio or video recording as I forgot to record. However, I took notes as my participant looked at it. 

## Accessibility check

## Design System
### Typeface:
| Scale Category  | Typeface | Weight | Size | Case | Letter Spacing
| ------------- | ------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Title | Lato | Bold | 36 | Sentence | -1%
Subtitle | Catamaran | Regular | 24 | Sentence | 0%
Body | Catamaran | Regular | 16 | Sentence | 0.5%
Button | Catamaran | SemiBold | 16 | All caps | 1.25%
Caption | Catamaran | Light | 14 | Sentence | 0%

I liked the combination of Lato and Catamaran the best as it was the most cohesive. I liked that both of these typefaces offered a lot of different weights, which could be utilized to create depth and hiearchy. 

### Colors:

I decided to go with an analogous color scheme that largely resembles the current Nevada Dept of Education website. I initially tried out a complementary color scheme to make it a little more colorful with blue and orange. However, the orange did not pass the accessibility (color contrast) test, so I decided to change it to analogous scheme. I tried to use darker blues so as to make it look formal. The original background has an image but I decided not to leave it with an image due to accessibility issues and instead, I made it a solid color with a tint of blue (#F8FAFB). I also added subtle drop shadows to the buttons to make them pop a little. 

### Layout grid + spacing:

I struggled the most with deciding the layout grid and spacing. I was unsure of how many columns and rows I should use and how wide or narrow the gutters and margins should be. I decided to play around with it and this was what I got in the end.
