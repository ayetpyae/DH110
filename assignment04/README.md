# Assignment 4: Persona + Scenario

## The Purpose of UX Storytelling
- To understand the users from their perspectives and see how they view the world.
- Recognize target users' behaviors, pain points, goals, challenges, and more.
- Create designs that focuses on users' needs through creating and analyzing personas in detail.

## Design Features
Based on my previous research, I have identified 2 features that needs to be improved upon or implemented.
- **Live chat**: A live chatbox feature will be helpful for getting answers to questions immediately - just like a phone call but digital instead.
- **Navigation bar**: A more organized navigation bar needs to be created as the current one was found to be too cluttered.
