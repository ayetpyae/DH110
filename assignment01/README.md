# Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation
## Education in Nevada
Aye Pyae | DH110 | Fall 2021
### About the project
Nevada's K-12 public education system is ranked one of the lowest nationally. 
COVID-19 gave rise to need for digitalized information.
Good user interface design is crucial for parents, students, and more to access information easily. Hence, I will be analyzing 
Description about the project how you want to contribute with your UX Design

### Jakob Nielson's [10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/)
| Heuristic | Description | Example |
|---|----|---|
|**1. Visibility of system status**| The design communicates clearly to users about what is going on, which allows them to learn and understand interactions with different components. | Battery status bar shows the amount of battery life remaining on a device.
|**2. Match between system and the real world** | The design uses terms and concepts that are used in the real world and presents information in a familiar manner to users. | Elevator shows an up arrow when it is going up.
|**3. User control and freedom** | The design allows users to correct mistakes and provides an 'emergency exit' to leave unwanted actions. | Cancel button allows user to exit the current interaction.
|**4. Consistency and standards** | The design should be consistent with other platforms and industry standards so that they are easy for users to learn the system fast. | Clicking the home icon brings you to the homepage on all websites.
|**5. Error prevention** | The website is designed so that error-prone conditions are eliminated or checked and presented to users before they go through with the action. | A pop-up message appears when a user tries to exit a document after inputting information without saving it.
|**6. Recognition rather than recall** | The design of elements, actions, and options are clearly identifiable and information required to navigate the website is recognizable and accessible. | Microsoft Word lists out recently opened files that can be easily accessed and users do not need to remember where they saved them.
|**7. Flexibility and efficiency of use** | The design has flexible processes for both inexperienced and experienced users so that they can pick which ever method suits them best. | Shortcuts such as 'ctrl f' allow users to find anything they want on a document or website using keywords.
|**8. Aesthetic and minimalist design** | The website is presented in a concise and useful manner and irrelevant or excessive elements that can interfere with usability should be ommited. | Learn more button allows users to obtain additional information if they want without overloading the original page.
|**9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors** | Error message expressed in simple terms and presented so that users can recognize and solve them. | When a wrong password is inputted, the website/app notifies users that it is wrong and gives the option to create a new password through the 'Forget Password?' option.
|**10. Help and documentation** | Resources are provided to clarify information and answer the questions of users. | FAQ page to answer frequently asked questions.

### [Severity Ratings for Usability Problems](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/)
Rating scaled used to evaluate severity of usability problems:  
**0** = not a usability problem  
**1** = cosmetic problem only; no need to be fixed unless there's extra time available  
**2** = minor usability problem; low priority to fix  
**3** = major usability problem; high priority to fix  
**4** = usability catastrophe; need to be fixed immediately
