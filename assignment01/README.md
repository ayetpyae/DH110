## Education in Nevada
Aye Pyae | DH110 | Fall 2021
### About the project
COVID-19 changed the education system drastically, with the need for online schooling and remote learning. It also gave rise to the need for digitalized information. 
Good user interface design is crucial for parents, students, and more to access information easily, especially since they are unable to meet with teachers or administrators in person to ask any questions that they have. Hence, I will be analyzing the usability of the Nevada Department of Education website as well as the Nevada System of Higher Education website using Nielson's 10 Usability Heuristics.

### Jakob Nielson's [10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/)
| Heuristic | Description | Example |
|---|----|---|
|**1. Visibility of system status**| The design communicates clearly to users about what is going on, which allows them to learn and understand interactions with different components. | Battery status bar shows the amount of battery life remaining on a device.
|**2. Match between system and the real world** | The design uses terms and concepts that are used in the real world and presents information in a familiar manner to users. | Elevator shows an up arrow when it is going up.
|**3. User control and freedom** | The design allows users to correct mistakes and provides an 'emergency exit' to leave unwanted actions. | Cancel button allows user to exit the current interaction.
|**4. Consistency and standards** | The design should be consistent with other platforms and industry standards so that they are easy for users to learn the system fast. | Clicking the home icon brings you to the homepage on all websites.
|**5. Error prevention** | The website is designed so that error-prone conditions are eliminated or checked and presented to users before they go through with the action. | A pop-up message appears when a user tries to exit a document after inputting information without saving it.
|**6. Recognition rather than recall** | The design of elements, actions, and options are clearly identifiable and information required to navigate the website is recognizable and accessible. | Microsoft Word lists out recently opened files that can be easily accessed and users do not need to remember where they saved them.
|**7. Flexibility and efficiency of use** | The design has flexible processes for both inexperienced and experienced users so that they can pick which ever method suits them best. | Shortcuts such as 'ctrl f' allow users to find anything they want on a document or website using keywords.
|**8. Aesthetic and minimalist design** | The website is presented in a concise and useful manner and irrelevant or excessive elements that can interfere with usability should be ommited. | Learn more button allows users to obtain additional information if they want without overloading the original page.
|**9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors** | Error message expressed in simple terms and presented so that users can recognize and solve them. | When a wrong password is inputted, the website/app notifies users that it is wrong and gives the option to create a new password through the 'Forget Password?' option.
|**10. Help and documentation** | Resources are provided to clarify information and answer the questions of users. | FAQ page to answer frequently asked questions.

### [Severity Ratings for Usability Problems](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/)
Rating scaled used to evaluate severity of usability problems:  
**0** = not a usability problem  
**1** = cosmetic problem only; no need to be fixed unless there's extra time available  
**2** = minor usability problem; low priority to fix  
**3** = major usability problem; high priority to fix

### Background Information
The Nevada's Department of Education oversees the public K-12 education system in Nevada. The website provides all the information on K-12 education for all people from educators to parents and students. It also has on information on COVID-19 and how they are dealing with it.
### Overall evaluation
Overall, the website is cluttered and there is an overload of information. There are many issues that make it confusing to navigate the website, such as poor color contrast as an excessive amount of unnessary elements. It is also visually overwhelming with the dark drop shadows and stock photos with text on them. The website is not very user friendly. 

### Heuristic evaluation
| Heuristic | Evaluation | Severity Rating | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|
|**1. Visibility of system status**| Bad: As you type in the search bar, possible options are not displayed below, like it usually would for other websites and apps like Google and Facebook. This makes it hard for users to determine whether their interaction is working as there is no appropriate feedback. | 2 | Display result predictions as the user types so that they will know that the system is working.
|**2. Match between system + real world** | Good: Language used is clear and matches that of the real world. When users click on the search icon, a search bar pops up. Bad: The button that leads to the home page is not clearly defined. It says "Nevada Ready!" which is the logo to an educational initiative but not the logo of the Department of Education. This is confusing to users who are used to clicking either a home button or the logo of the organization to go back to the home page. | 1 | Include a home tab that is clearly labelled or change the home button to something more clear such as the logo of the Nevada Department of Education.
|**3. User control and freedom** | Good: When users click on the print icon, they are brought to a page with information on what they want to print. There is a cancel button that allows them to exit the page in case they do not want to print.  Bad: After typing and searching something using the search bar, the user's query is removed when they exit the search results. | 2 | Don't erase the user's query after the exit out of the search results in case they want to modify the search using different keywords.
|**4. Consistency and standards** | Good: There is a horizontal menu bar at the top of the page which allows users to go to different pages. Good: Social media icons lead to the social media pages for the Nevada Department of Education. Bad: Some pages have a background with a picture while others don't, which is inconsistent visually. | 1 | Delete the picture backgrounds on the pages with them.
|**5. Error prevention** |  Bad: The search bar is not wide enough to see the entered data if it is long. This is bad especially because people who navigate the website may be parents with long questions. | 1 | Use a wider search bar. 
|**6. Recognition rather than recall** | Bad: The search bar does not remember user's previous searches. This makes it difficult for users to remember what they have already looked up and what they have not. | 2 | Previous searches should be displayed below the search bar.
|**7. Flexibility and efficiency of use** | Good: The ctrl f function can be used to easily look up something on the page with a keyword. | 0 | No recommendation needed.
|**8. Aesthetic and minimalist design** | Bad: There is an overload of information and there is no hiearchy of information. There are too many tabs with too many drop down options which can confuse users. Bad: There is poor color contrast on the first page where the text in white is put up against a photo. | 3 | Use sub-tabs to organize. For example for the Programs tab, create a primary drop down option categorized by level of education (elementary, middle, high school, etc.) and then a secondary drop down option with its respective programs after users sect the primary drop down option. Delete the photo or add more contrast by making it darker.
|**9. Help users with errors** | Good: When something that cannot be found on the page is typed in the search box, the results highlights a "No Results" box to inform users that nothing can be found with the keywords they searched. | 0 | No recommendation needed. 
|**10. Help and documentation** | Good: There is a FAQ page and a Contact Us button. Bad: The FAQ page is hidden all the way at the bottom of the first menu tab. | 3 | Make the FAQ page more visible by making it it's own menu tab option or organize tab drop down options better so that the FAQ page is not hidden.

View the website here: [Nevada System of Higher Education](https://nshe.nevada.edu/) 
### Background Information
The Nevada System of Higher Education is a department under the state of Nevada that oversees the public system of all colleges and universitys in Nevada that are state supported and funded. The website has information for students, employees, media, and more.

### Overall evaluation
The website is clean and generally visually appealing to look at. However, it is confusing to navigate as there are no hiearchy of information. There is also no about page for users to learn more about what the Nevada System of Higher Education does.
### Heuristic evaluation
| Heuristic | Evaluation | Severity Rating | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|
|**1. Visibility of system status**| Good: For the [Board of Regents Public Comment Form](https://nshe.nevada.edu/public-comment/), when users type in the wrong email address, the system informs them by stating that the email address entered is invalid. After a message is sent, a message that informs the users that it has been sent pop ups. Bad: However, the invalid email address message only pop ups after the user clicks the send button. Also, the system does not inform the users that what they are typing may be invalid for the other fields such as Address and Phone Number. This can lead to spam messages. | 3 | Change it so that a message pop ups underneath the Phone Number field to inform users when they do not type in a valid 10 digit number.
|**2. Match between system + real world** | Good: Language used is clear and matches that of the real world. When users click on the search icon, a search bar pops up. | 0 | No recommendation needed.
|**3. User control and freedom** | Good: When the search icon is clicked, there is a X button that pops up along with a search bar. This allows users to exit the search bar if they no longer need it. Bad: After typing and searching something using the search bar, the user's query is removed when they exit the search results. | 2 | Don't erase the user's query after the exit out of the search results in case they want to modify the search using different keywords.
|**4. Consistency and standards** | Good: There is a horizontal menu bar at the top of the page which allows users to go to different pages. After users go to different pages, they are informed near the top how they got there as the tabs they clicked on are clearly stated. Bad: There is no about page for users to learn more about what the Nevada System of Higher Education is about. | 3 | An about page should be added so that users can learn more about what the Nevada System of Higher Education is about.
|**5. Error prevention** | Bad: The forms do not have spell check nor grammar check options. Bad: For the [Board of Regents Public Comment Form](https://nshe.nevada.edu/public-comment/), the site lets user go to a different tab without saving or submitting their work. | 3 | Add spell check and a grammar check options, include a pop-up message that informs users they are about to leave without saving or submitting their work.
|**6. Recognition rather than recall** | Good: The links to the social media pages, as well as the Newsletter and Contact Us icons are labelled with words, which is good for people who are not familiar with the icons. Bad: The search bar does not remember user's previous searches. This makes it difficult for users to remember what they have already looked up and what they have not. | 2 | Previous searches should be displayed below the search bar.
|**7. Flexibility and efficiency of use** | Good: The ctrl f function can be used to easily look up something on the page with a keyword. | 0 | No recommendation needed.
|**8. Aesthetic and minimalist design** | Good: The website is visually clean, with no unnecessary design elements. Good: The drop down options on the different tabs are categorized accordingly. | 0 | No recommendation needed.
|**9. Help users with errors** | Good: For the [Board of Regents Public Comment Form](https://nshe.nevada.edu/public-comment/), when users type in the wrong email address, the system informs them by stating that the email address entered is invalid. After a message is sent, a message that informs the users that it has been sent pop ups. Bad: This is not the case for the other fields | 3 | Change it so that a message pop ups underneath the Phone Number field to inform users when they do not type in a valid 10 digit number.
|**10. Help and documentation** | Good: There is a contact us button that is clearly labelled. Bad: There is no FAQ option on the menu tabs and FAQ page for the System of Higher Education in general. Users have search FAQ through the search bar and the results only show FAQ for different programs. | 3 | Include a FAQ page that is visible and easy to access.
