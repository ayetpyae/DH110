# Accessible Nevada Department of Education Website
Aye Pyae | DH110 | Fall 2021

## Introduction
This project examines the current Nevada Department of Education website using a user-centered design approach. COVID-19 dramatically changed schooling in the United States, with the need for online schooling, remote learning, and digitalized information and resources. The Nevada's Department of Education (DOE) oversees the public K-12 education system in Nevada. The website provides all the information on K-12 education for all people from educators to parents and students. Good user interface design is crucial for parents, students, educators, and more to access information and resources easily. This project strives to improve the design of the current website in order for its users to have a better user experience. 

## Design statement
The current Nevada Department of Education website is formal, outdated, and cluttered. Through my UX design project, I hope to make it more user-friendly and organized by improving upon some design features as well as implementing new ones. I conducted research, carried out contextual inquiries and usability testing, and created personas and empathy maps to understand the users considerably and create a user-centered design project.

## Competitor analysis [assignment01 & 02]:
I conducted a heuristics evaluation and usability testing of the current Nevada Department of Education website to get a better sense of the current user flow and design problems.
