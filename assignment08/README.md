# Accessible Nevada Department of Education Website
Aye Pyae | DH110 | Fall 2021

## Introduction
This project examines the current Nevada Department of Education website using a user-centered design approach. COVID-19 dramatically changed schooling in the United States, with the need for online schooling, remote learning, and digitalized information and resources. The Nevada's Department of Education (DOE) oversees the public K-12 education system in Nevada. The website provides all the information on K-12 education for all people from educators to parents and students. Good user interface design is crucial for parents, students, educators, and more to access information and resources easily. This project strives to improve the design of the current website in order for its users to have a better user experience. 

## Design statement
The current Nevada Department of Education website is formal, outdated, and cluttered. Through my UX design project, I hope to make it more user-friendly and organized by improving upon some design features as well as implementing new ones. I conducted research, carried out contextual inquiries and usability testing, and created personas and empathy maps to understand the users considerably and create a user-centered design project.

## Competitor Analysis
I conducted a heuristics evaluation and usability testing of the current Nevada Department of Education website to get a better sense of the current user flow and design problems. 

### Heuristics Evaluation
I analyzed the usability of the Nevada Department of Education website using Jakob Nielson's [10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/). Three main usability concerns emerged as I conducted the evaluation:
1. The entire website is **cluttered and overloaded with information**. There is no hierarchy of information and the entire website in general is not user friendly. There are too many tabs with too many drop down options which can confuse users. The website scored a 3 on the severity rating on the aesthetic and minimalist design heuristic. 
2. The website did **poorly on the recognition rather than recall heuristic**. The search bar does not remember user's previous searches, which makes it difficult for users to remember what they have already looked up and what they have not. 
3. The website **scored a 3 on the severity rating for the help and documentation heuristic**. The FAQ page is hidden all the way at the bottom of the first menu tab and is not visible.

### Usability Testing
Given the concerns uncovered from the heuristics evaluation, I conduct a usability test to understand the extent to which the design of the website hinders users' ability to use the website to find information on the Department of Education. The test captured the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of the Nevada DOE website. The goal of this test was to empathise with users and make improvements to the website by understanding the user's perspective. I asked my participant to perform three tasks:
1. Find the internship page of the website and complete some tasks. Here, I tried to understand how college students may navigate the website. 
2. Find information on one of the many programs that are listed on the website, which is the English Language Learner Program. It illuminated the degree to which the cluttered information and the many tabs with too many drop down options hinder users' ability to find information they need. 
3. Find the FAQ and contact us pages. I found out the extent to which users struggle with this task and justified the website scoring a 3 on the severity rating for the help and documentation heuristic.

## User Research - Contextual Inquiry:
After conducting usability testing, I sought to understand users and how they navigated the web to find information on the general topic of K-12 education. I decided to use a combination of two methods to do so: participatory observation and interview.
- For participatory observation I observed how my participant gathered her information online.
- For the interview, I asked her some questions on her thoughts on K-12 education and her ways of finding information on that topic (online, word-of-mouth, etc.)

Through this, I gained a better understanding of how users thought about the topic of K-12 education and how they gathered information on the topic. The user confirmed my initial thoughts about different government websites. She used words like outdated, formal, and cluttered to describe the California Department of Education. I also learned a lot from her behavior. The following are some insights I made from the activity:
- Word of mouth is an important way to gain information about K-12 education
- User's view on government websites: formal, lots of information, overwhelming, and cluttered
- Users rely on the generated list of questions and keywords to find more relevant information
- Users are more inclined to read text that are more organized

## UX Storytelling - Personas and Scenarios
Next, I created 2 personas and empathy maps and came up with scenarios and journey maps in order to
- understand the users from their perspectives and see how they view the world, 
- recognize target users' behaviors, pain points, goals, challenges, and more, and 
- create designs that focuses on users' needs through creating and analyzing personas in detail.
Through this process, I understood what user-centered design means and how to take into consideration my users' needs and wants when interacting with an application.

Here are the personas I created:

## Low-fidelity prototype
After conducting user research and gaining a greater understanding of the product/service I was working on for the project, I finally started designing the actual app. I decided that the two main features I wanted to improve and/implement were a live chatbox and a more organized menu.(CHANGEEEE)

**Wireframes and Wireflows**
I first started by sketching wireframes and drawing wireflows.

**Low-fidelity prototype testing**
Next, I conducted a low-fidelity prototype test by asking a participant to connect the wireframes that I created and I screen recorded the process. I guided her to try out the features and complete the tasks. She talked out loud throughout the process and noted the places where she was confused. The [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NsBdAfZqXOv2WWshxM59m9dQJbyNXiPw/view?usp=sharing) can be found here.

Afterwards, I made changes accordingly and created a digitized wireflow and low-fidelity prototype. The link to the [digitized low-fidelity prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/trP3i7bvv5q4Fne0HNCsaw/NevadaDeptOfEducationProject?node-id=0%3A1) can be found here.
