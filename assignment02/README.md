## Introduction
The Nevada's Department of Education (DOE) oversees the public K-12 education system in Nevada. The website provides all the information on K-12 education for all people from educators to parents and students. It also has on information on COVID-19 and how they are dealing with it.

After conducted a heuristic evaluation on the Nevada DOE Website, many usability concerns emerged. First, the entire website is cluttered and overloaded with information. There is no hierarchy of information and the entire website in general is not user friendly. There are too many tabs with too many drop down options which can confuse users. The website scored a 3 on the severity rating on the aesthetic and minimalist design heuristic. Second, the website did poorly on the recognition rather than recall heuristic, as the search bar does not remember user's previous searches, which makes it difficult for users to remember what they have already looked up and what they have not. Third, the website scored a 3 on the severity rating for the help and documentation heuristic. The FAQ page is hidden all the way at the bottom of the first menu tab and is not visible.

Given these concerns, I will conduct a usability test to understand the extent to which the design of the website hinders users' ability to use the website to find information on the Department of Education. The test will capture the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of the Nevada DOE website. Task 1 will ask the user to find the internship page of the website and complete some tasks. Here, I will try to understand how college students may navigate the website. Task 2 will ask the user to find information on one of the many programs that are listed on the website, which is the English Language Learner Program. It will illuminate the degree to which the cluttered information and the many tabs with too many drop down options hinders users' ability to find information they need. Task 3 will ask user to find the FAQ and contact us pages. I want to find out the extent to which users will struggle with this task as website scored a 3 on the severity rating for the help and documentation heuristic.

The goal of this test is to empathise with users and make improvements to the website by understanding the user's perspective.

## Methodology
The pilot usability test will be conducted in a quiet living room. The moderator will sitting next to the participant to guide her. A computer webcam will record the participant's reaction throughout the test. The screen of the computer that will be used to conduct the test will also be recorded. This is a pilot test, which means that the setting, materials and software are to be tested in order to refine the usabilty testing process. 

The moderator will introduce the usability test process, as well as ask for informed consent by reading the introduction and the form out loud. After the participant gives consent, she will fill out a pre-test questionnaire, and then complete each task with thinking out loud and articulating her thoughts, concerns, and questions. After completing the tasks, she will complete a post-test questionnaire which will measure how usable the website was using the System Usability Scale. She will also pick 5 key words that best describes what she thinks of the website and its interface.At the very end, she will fill out her demographics after the recording is stopped to maintain confidentiality.

## Reflection
The pilot usability test taught me both about the usability of the Nevada State of Department Website, as well as the process of usability testing itself.

The pilot usability test confirmed what I found out about the Nevada DOE website after evaluating its heuristics. My participant expressed frustrations out loud, as well as by having a hard time finding information while completing each tasks.  She noted that the website was extremely cluttered and she described the website as boring, cheap, old, unprofessional, and intimidating due to the overload of information. She pointed out the footer in particular, saying that it was the longest footer she has ever seen with way too many tabs and hyperlinks that are difficult to navigate. Overall, the participant's experience while completing the tasks strongly suggest that the Nevada DOE Website needs drastic change and improvements.

Besides that, I also learned a great deal about the usabilty testing process. I finally understood why this process is so costly and time consuming. 

Overall, aLthough there were a few hiccups here and there as it was my first time conducting a usability test, it went pretty well. The participant was eager and worked on the tasks actively, and the test flowed smoothly. However, there were some issues that could be improved upon. Firstly, the
